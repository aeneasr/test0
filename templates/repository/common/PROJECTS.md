<!--BEGIN ECOSYSTEM-->

We build Ory on several guiding principles when it comes to our architecture
design:

- Minimal dependencies
- Runs everywhere
- Scales without effort
- Minimize room for human and network errors

ORY's architecture designed to run best on a Container Orchestration Systems
such as Kubernetes, CloudFoundry, OpenShift, and similar projects. Binaries are
small (5-15MB) and available for all popular processor types (ARM, AMD64, i386)
and operating systems (FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, Windows) without system
dependencies (Java, Node, Ruby, libxml, ...).

### ORY Kratos: Identity and User Infrastructure and Management

[ORY Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) is an API-first Identity and User
Management system that is built according to
[cloud architecture best practices](https://www.ory.sh/docs/next/ecosystem/software-architecture-philosophy).
It implements core use cases that almost every software application needs to
deal with: Self-service Login and Registration, Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA/2FA), Account Recovery and Verification, Profile and Account Management.

### ORY Hydra: OAuth2 & OpenID Connect Server

[ORY Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) is an OpenID Certifiedâ„¢ OAuth2 and
OpenID Connect Provider can connect to any existing identity database (LDAP, AD,
KeyCloak, PHP+MySQL, ...) and user interface.

### ORY Oathkeeper: Identity & Access Proxy

[ORY Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) is a BeyondCorp/Zero Trust
Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) with configurable authentication, authorization,
and request mutation rules for your web services: Authenticate JWT, Access
Tokens, API Keys, mTLS; Check if the contained subject is allowed to perform the
request; Encode resulting content into custom headers (`X-User-ID`), JSON Web
Tokens and more!

### ORY Keto: Access Control Policies as a Server

[ORY Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto) is a policy decision point. It uses a
set of access control policies, similar to AWS IAM Policies, in order to
determine whether a subject (user, application, service, car, ...) is authorized
to perform a certain action on a resource.
